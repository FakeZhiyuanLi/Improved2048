# 2048 Math Project
This is the code used in my 2048 math project for Algebra II Honors

The only required library is pygame 

You can change the size of the board on line 18 in either the 2048.py or 2048ai.py file
You can also change the amount of moves the bot makes a second on line 86 in the 2048ai.py file. A higher value means more moves a second.
